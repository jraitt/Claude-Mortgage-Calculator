# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for adding interactive chart visualizations to the Mortgage Tools Pro application. The charts will help users better understand their mortgage data through visual representations of payment breakdowns, paydown strategy comparisons, and balance trends over time.

## Glossary

- **Chart_Component**: A React component that renders interactive data visualizations
- **Mortgage_Tools_Pro**: The main application providing mortgage calculation tools
- **Tab_Component**: Individual calculator views (New Mortgage, Existing Mortgage, Points, Refinance)
- **Amortization_Schedule**: Month-by-month payment breakdown showing principal and interest
- **Paydown_Strategy**: Different approaches to paying off a mortgage faster (bi-weekly, extra payments, etc.)
- **Chart_Library**: Third-party JavaScript library for rendering charts (Chart.js, Recharts, or visx)
- **Responsive_Chart**: Chart that adapts to different screen sizes and orientations
- **Dark_Mode**: Application theme with dark background colors
- **Shared_Components**: Reusable UI components located in components/shared/

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a homeowner using the New Mortgage calculator, I want to see a visual breakdown of my principal vs interest payments, so that I can better understand how my money is allocated over the loan term.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user navigates to the New Mortgage tab, THE Chart_Component SHALL display a pie chart showing the total principal vs interest breakdown
2. WHEN the loan parameters change, THE Chart_Component SHALL update the pie chart data in real-time
3. WHEN the user hovers over chart segments, THE Chart_Component SHALL display tooltips with exact dollar amounts and percentages
4. WHERE dark mode is enabled, THE Chart_Component SHALL render with appropriate dark theme colors
5. WHILE viewing on mobile devices, THE Chart_Component SHALL maintain readability and touch-friendly interactions

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a homeowner comparing paydown strategies, I want to see a visual comparison of different payment approaches, so that I can quickly identify which strategy saves the most money and time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user enables multiple paydown strategies in the Existing Mortgage tab, THE Chart_Component SHALL display a bar chart comparing total interest saved for each strategy
2. WHEN paydown strategy parameters change, THE Chart_Component SHALL update the bar chart data automatically
3. WHEN the user clicks on a bar in the chart, THE Chart_Component SHALL highlight the corresponding strategy in the summary cards
4. THE Chart_Component SHALL display strategy names as x-axis labels and interest savings as y-axis values
5. WHERE a strategy shows negative savings, THE Chart_Component SHALL use a different color to indicate increased cost

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a homeowner analyzing my mortgage over time, I want to see how my loan balance decreases with different payment strategies, so that I can visualize the long-term impact of my choices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views the Existing Mortgage tab with paydown strategies enabled, THE Chart_Component SHALL display a line chart showing balance over time for each strategy
2. WHEN the loan term exceeds 10 years, THE Chart_Component SHALL display data points at yearly intervals to maintain chart readability
3. WHEN the user hovers over data points, THE Chart_Component SHALL show the exact balance amount and date
4. THE Chart_Component SHALL use different colored lines for each paydown strategy
5. WHILE displaying multiple strategies, THE Chart_Component SHALL include a legend identifying each line

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user of the application, I want charts to work seamlessly with the existing design system, so that the visual experience remains consistent and professional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Chart_Component SHALL use the same color palette as existing SummaryCard components
2. WHEN the application theme changes between light and dark mode, THE Chart_Component SHALL update colors automatically
3. THE Chart_Component SHALL follow the same responsive breakpoints as other components (sm, md, lg)
4. WHERE charts are added to tabs, THE Chart_Component SHALL integrate with existing FormField and DataTable layouts
5. THE Chart_Component SHALL maintain accessibility standards with proper ARIA labels and keyboard navigation

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the application, I want chart components to follow the established architecture patterns, so that they are easy to test, maintain, and extend.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Chart_Component SHALL be created as reusable components in the components/shared/ directory
2. WHEN chart data is needed, THE Chart_Component SHALL consume data from existing calculation hooks
3. THE Chart_Component SHALL use TypeScript interfaces for all props and data structures
4. WHERE charts require configuration, THE Chart_Component SHALL accept props for customization without breaking existing functionality
5. THE Chart_Component SHALL include JSDoc comments documenting all props and usage examples
