## FAQ

### Q: Does this calculator save my data?
**A**: No, all calculations are performed client-side in your browser. Your data never leaves your device and is not stored on any server.

### Q: Can I use this for commercial mortgages?
**A**: This calculator is designed for residential mortgages. While it can handle various loan structures, it doesn't include commercial-specific features like balloon payments or interest-only periods.

### Q: Is the amortization schedule accurate?
**A**: Yes, the calculator uses standard mortgage amortization formulas. However, always verify calculations with your lender, as they may include additional fees or use slightly different calculation methods.

### Q: Can I save multiple loan scenarios?
**A**: Not yet, but this feature is planned (see TASK-009 in `TASK.md`). Currently, you can export scenarios to CSV and save them locally.

### Q: Why doesn't my actual monthly payment match the calculator?
**A**: Your lender may include additional fees not captured by this calculator (HOA dues, additional escrow items, origination fees, etc.). This calculator shows the core components: principal, interest, PMI, property tax, and insurance.

### Q: How do I report a bug or request a feature?
**A**: Please open an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/jraitt/Claude-Mortgage-Calculator/issues) with a detailed description.
