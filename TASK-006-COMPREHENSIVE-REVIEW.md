## Current TASK-006 Scope

**Existing Suggestions**:
- Principal vs Interest Chart (pie chart) - New Mortgage tab
- Paydown Comparison Chart (bar chart) - Existing Mortgage tab
- Balance Over Time Chart (line chart) - Existing Mortgage tab

**Missing**:
- No suggestions for Refinance Calculator tab
- No suggestions for Points Calculator tab
- Limited visualization variety

## Implementation Recommendations

### Chart Library Selection

**Recommended**: **Recharts** (already mentioned in TASK-006)

**Pros**:
- React-native, hooks-friendly
- Responsive and mobile-ready
- Supports all needed chart types
- Excellent TypeScript support
- Good dark mode support
- Lightweight (~100kb)
- Active maintenance

**Alternatives**:
- **Chart.js** - More features but heavier

## Chart Features & Standards

### All Charts Should Include:

1. **Responsive Design**
   - Desktop: Full width with optimal height
   - Tablet: Adjusted aspect ratio
   - Mobile: Scroll horizontally if needed or stack

2. **Dark Mode Support**
   - Use theme-aware colors
   - Ensure contrast in both modes
   - Update axis labels for visibility

3. **Tooltips**
   - Show precise values on hover
   - Include context (dates, percentages)
   - Format currency properly

4. **Accessibility**
   - Add ARIA labels
   - Ensure color-blind friendly palettes
   - Provide data table alternatives

5. **Export Options** (Nice to have)
   - Export chart as PNG
   - Include in CSV exports
   - Print-friendly versions

6. **Performance**
   - Use `useMemo` for data transformations
   - Lazy load charts (only render visible ones)
   - Sample data for very long schedules (>360 months)

## Color Palette Recommendations

### Chart Colors (Light Mode)
```javascript
const chartColors = {
  primary: '#3B82F6',      // Blue - current/standard
  secondary: '#10B981',    // Green - new/savings
  tertiary: '#F59E0B',     // Orange - warning/caution
  danger: '#EF4444',       // Red - costs/interest
  purple: '#8B5CF6',       // Purple - alternative
  teal: '#14B8A6',         // Teal - additional
}
```

### Chart Colors (Dark Mode)
```javascript
const chartColorsDark = {
  primary: '#60A5FA',      // Lighter blue
  secondary: '#34D399',    // Lighter green
  tertiary: '#FBBF24',     // Lighter orange
  danger: '#F87171',       // Lighter red
  purple: '#A78BFA',       // Lighter purple
  teal: '#2DD4BF',         // Lighter teal
}
```

## Priority Ranking

### Must-Have (Phase 1 Priority):
1. ⭐⭐⭐ **Refinance Tab Charts** - Highest user value, most compelling visuals
   - Monthly payment comparison
   - Break-even timeline
   - Cumulative interest comparison
2. ⭐⭐ **Existing Mortgage Tab** - Shows dramatic savings
   - Balance comparison line chart
   - Paydown strategy comparison
3. ⭐⭐ **New Mortgage Tab** - Foundation understanding
   - Principal vs Interest pie chart
   - Balance over time

### Should-Have (Phase 2 Priority):
4. ⭐ **Points Calculator Tab** - Helps complex decisions
   - Cost comparison at time horizons
   - Break-even comparison
5. Additional charts for tabs above

### Nice-to-Have (Phase 3 Priority):
6. Radar charts, waterfall charts, advanced visualizations
7. Chart export functionality
8. Interactive chart features (zoom, pan)

---

## Key Insights & Recommendations

### 1. Refinance Tab is the Highest Priority
The refinance calculator has the most comparative data and would benefit most from visualizations. Users making refinance decisions need to see:
- Whether they'll save money
- When they'll break even
- How much interest they'll save
- Long-term cost implications

**Recommendation**: Start with Refinance tab charts for maximum user impact.

### 2. Points Calculator Needs Visual Help
The current points calculator has a complex data table. Charts would make it much more intuitive, especially:
- Which scenario wins at different timeframes
- Break-even visualization
- Cost accumulation over time

**Recommendation**: Prioritize points tab after refinance tab.

### 3. Existing Mortgage Tab Has High Drama Factor
The side-by-side comparison of paydown strategies could be much more compelling with charts showing:
- How much faster the balance decreases
- Years/months saved visualized
- Interest savings magnitude

**Recommendation**: Strong candidate for early implementation.

### 4. Charts Should Be Collapsible
Given the amount of data already on each tab, consider making charts collapsible or toggleable to avoid overwhelming users.

**Recommendation**: Add show/hide toggle buttons for chart sections.

### 5. Mobile Considerations
Some charts (especially multi-line and grouped bars) may be difficult on mobile. Consider:
- Horizontal scrolling for complex charts
- Simplified mobile versions
- Option to view full-screen

**Recommendation**: Test all charts thoroughly on mobile devices.

## Benefits of Implementation

### User Experience
- **Visual Clarity**: Complex financial data becomes immediately understandable
- **Decision Support**: Charts make trade-offs obvious
- **Engagement**: Interactive visualizations keep users engaged
- **Confidence**: Seeing data visually builds trust in calculations

### Technical Benefits
- **Reusable Components**: Shared chart components reduce code duplication
- **Maintainability**: Charts can be updated independently of calculations
- **Scalability**: Easy to add more charts in the future
- **Modern UX**: Brings the app up to contemporary standards

### Competitive Advantage
Most mortgage calculators have limited or no visualizations. Adding comprehensive charts would make Mortgage Tools Pro stand out significantly.

## Next Steps

1. **Review and Approve**: Get stakeholder approval on chart selections
2. **Prioritize**: Decide which tab to implement first (recommend: Refinance)
3. **Install Dependencies**: Add Recharts to project
4. **Create Foundation**: Build shared chart components
5. **Implement by Tab**: Roll out charts tab by tab
6. **Test & Iterate**: Gather feedback and refine

---

## Questions for Consideration

1. Should charts be always visible or collapsible?
2. Should there be an export option for charts?
3. What's the priority order for tab implementation?
4. Should we add chart animations? (Can slow down renders)
5. Should charts update in real-time as inputs change?
6. Do we want print-friendly versions of charts?
