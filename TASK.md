**Completed**: 2025-10-24
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE
**Priority**: Critical
**Effort**: Large (Complete Modular Refactoring)

**Description**: The main `MortgageCalculator.tsx` component was 2,273 lines, violating maintainability principles. Successfully refactored into a comprehensive modular architecture with shared components, custom hooks, and specialized tab components.

**Final Results**:
- **Original Size**: 2,273 lines (monolithic)

## 🟠 High Priority

### TASK-002: Expand Testing Coverage
**Added**: 2025-10-12
**Updated**: 2025-10-24
**Status**: 🔵 In Progress
**Priority**: High
**Effort**: Medium (1-2 days)

**Description**: Initial testing framework is set up with Jest + React Testing Library. Tests exist for validation and some calculations. The recent refactoring makes component testing much easier - now we can test individual tab components and hooks in isolation.

**Current Coverage**:
- ✅ Validation utilities (`utils/validation.ts`) - Comprehensive tests
- ✅ Refinance calculations - Basic tests
- ✅ Custom hooks (`useBasicMetrics`, `usePointsComparison`, `useLocalStorage`) covered via renderHook tests
- ✅ Shared components (FormField, SummaryCard, DataTable) verified with RTL
- ✅ CalcTabNewMortgage smoke test ensures orchestration wiring
- ⚠️ Remaining calculation modules and other tabs still need deeper coverage to hit 80%+

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [x] Install and configure Jest
- [x] Install and configure React Testing Library
- [x] Create `utils/__tests__/` directory structure
- [x] Add test scripts to `package.json`
- [x] Write tests for validation utilities
- [x] Write tests for refinance calculations
- [x] Write unit tests for custom hooks (useCalculations, useLocalStorage)
- [x] Write component tests for shared components (FormField, SummaryCard, DataTable)
- [x] Write component tests for tab components (at least smoke tests)
- [ ] Write tests for all calculation functions (80%+ coverage)
- [x] Document testing approach in README.md
- [ ] Set up GitHub Actions to run tests on PR

**Priority Tests to Add** (Now Much Easier After Refactoring):
1. **Hook Tests**:
   - `useBasicMetrics()` - Various loan scenarios
   - `useAmortizationSchedules()` - Different paydown strategies
   - `useLocalStorage()` - Save/load/clear operations

2. **Component Tests**:
   - `<FormField />` - Rendering, onChange, validation display
   - `<SummaryCard />` - Different color variants, metrics display
   - `<CalcTabNewMortgage />` - Smoke test, input handling

3. **Calculation Tests**:
   - Amortization schedule generation with edge cases
   - Points comparison with various scenarios
   - PMI calculations and LTV thresholds

**Unblocked**: TASK-001 complete - modular structure makes testing much easier!

## 🟡 Medium Priority

### TASK-004: Improve Mobile Responsiveness
**Added**: 2025-10-12
**Updated**: 2025-10-24
**Status**: 🟡 Not Started
**Priority**: Medium
**Effort**: Small (4-6 hours)

**Description**: While the app uses Tailwind responsive classes, some tables and forms could be better optimized for mobile screens. The new DataTable component provides a good foundation for this.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Test app on common mobile screen sizes (375px, 414px, etc.)
- [ ] Make DataTable component fully responsive with horizontal scroll
- [ ] Ensure FormField components stack properly on mobile
- [ ] Ensure tab navigation works on mobile (test touch interactions)
- [ ] Test all tab components on mobile viewports
- [ ] Verify side-by-side schedule comparison works on mobile
- [ ] Add viewport meta tags if missing
- [ ] Verify dark mode looks good on mobile

**Benefit from Refactoring**: Can now test each tab component's mobile layout independently!

### TASK-006: Add Chart Visualizations
**Added**: 2025-10-12
**Updated**: 2025-10-24
**Status**: 🟡 Not Started
**Priority**: Medium
**Effort**: Medium (1 day)

**Description**: Add visual charts to help users understand paydown strategies and interest breakdown. These can now be added as standalone components to specific tabs.

**Recommended Approach After Refactoring**:
- Add charts as new components in `components/shared/`
- Import into relevant tab components (CalcTabNewMortgage, CalcTabExistingMortgage)
- Use existing calculation hooks for data

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Research lightweight chart library (Chart.js, Recharts, or visx)
- [ ] Add dependency to `package.json`
- [ ] Create `<PrincipalVsInterestChart />` component - pie chart
- [ ] Create `<PaydownComparisonChart />` component - bar chart
- [ ] Create `<BalanceOverTimeChart />` component - line chart
- [ ] Add charts to appropriate tabs:
  - New Mortgage tab: Principal vs Interest pie
  - Existing Mortgage tab: Paydown comparison bars, Balance over time
- [ ] Ensure charts work with dark mode
- [ ] Make charts responsive
- [ ] Add chart components to shared exports
